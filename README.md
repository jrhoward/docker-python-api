# docker-python-api
Example API implementation using Python Flask for the APIs and Ngnix as a reverse proxy and HTTP server.

The API returns UNIX fortune cookies.

A static website served by Ngnix that calls the API and rotates Fortune cookies every 20 seconds.

There is also a slack integration using the slash command.

The run.sh file is self explanatory.
